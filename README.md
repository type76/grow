## Interactive video


combine scripts from these projects :
- https://io76.com/inside/
- https://type76.com/projects/baobab/
- https://type76.com/fluid/v2.html
- https://type76.com/projects/loop/

- simple interactive ambient toy (play/pause)
- mouse on computer, touch for mobile
- simple centered optional controls and EQ
- controls grow with the tree
- flat 2D controls and 3D tree

## Idea

- Growth cycle of the baobab
- Rustling and growing underground
- Fluid with root-like patterns


## Story

Binarual beat interface is introduced with a central play button. (gets smaller as time goes by)


-+----- (play) -+-----



The start is solid black. Lines/shapes grow from the center forming an up/down axis. Slowly you form roots, the shoot, flashes of bright solid colour from the center. Moving up. Toward the light. The thin white line at the top getting thicker and slowly taking up the screen. But at half way.. 

The seed reaches the ground level and the sun. Leaves. A beat. Lines to show timing. Black inverts to white. Explosion of colour. Fluid script introduced.

The fluid 'aura' of the tree grows and sways with the pulsing rhythm. Fractal growth. Lots of repetition. Arpeggio? Ska skanking echo/reverb? Photos of life flash in and out. Loop functions and controls come in here maybe.

The tree grows seed pods and the camera zooms in.. abrupt end.
